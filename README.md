In this project I wanted to create a tic tac toe game on a field 5x5.

I have based this project on this tutorial to help me better understand React -  https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

There are still some things I need to improve like when there is a draw it needs to be shown to the players
 plus reset after hiting the start button.

Also I made it almost impossible to win because you need to have five symbols in a row or diagonally.
